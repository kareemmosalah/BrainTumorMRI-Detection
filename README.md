# ðŸ§  Brain Tumor MRI Detection â€“ Data Acquisition & Image Processing Project

This project focuses on **data acquisition, preprocessing, and enhancement techniques** for MRI images of brain tumors. Rather than applying deep learning models, the emphasis here is on robust data handling, image analysis, and preparing datasets for potential machine learning applications.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Objective

To explore and enhance the process of working with brain MRI image datasets using Python. Key goals include:

- Efficiently acquiring and organizing image data
- Performing image inspection and format handling
- Applying preprocessing techniques (resizing, grayscale conversion, denoising, histogram analysis, etc.)
- Building a reusable pipeline for image analysis
